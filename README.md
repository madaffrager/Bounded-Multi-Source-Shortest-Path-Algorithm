> A comprehensive implementation and analysis of the Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm, comparing theoretical promises with practical performance.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of the **Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP)** algorithm, originally proposed as a "record-breaking" improvement over classical shortest path algorithms. 

**The Goal**: Translate academic pseudocode into working Python code and rigorously benchmark it against established algorithms like Dijkstra's.

**The Result**: A fascinating exploration of why theoretically superior algorithms don't always win in practice, and valuable insights into the gap between academic theory and software engineering reality.

## 🧠 Understanding BMSSP

### The Problem
Find shortest paths from multiple source vertices, but only up to a maximum distance B (the "bound"). This is practically important for:
- Social network analysis (friends within N degrees)
- Route planning with fuel/time constraints  
- Network topology analysis with hop limits

### The Innovation
BMSSP employs a **recursive divide-and-conquer strategy**:

1. **Fast Base Case**: Use bounded Dijkstra to explore easily reachable vertices
2. **Intelligent Decomposition**: Identify promising unexplored regions
3. **Recursive Solving**: Solve smaller subproblems with tighter bounds
4. **Result Merging**: Combine solutions back into the global answer

### The Secret Sauce: Batch Operations
The algorithm uses a specialized bucket-based priority queue that supports **batch decrease-key operations**. When thousands of shortest paths are updated simultaneously, traditional heaps require O(k log n) time for k updates. BMSSP can handle these updates in batches, theoretically reducing the amortized cost.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies required!

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madaffrager/Bounded-Multi-Source-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
cd Bounded-Multi-Source-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
```

### Running the Code

**1. Run the test suite** (recommended first step):
```bash
python test_algorithms.py
```

**2. See the algorithm in action**:
```bash
python bmssp_algorithm.py
```

**3. Run comprehensive benchmarks**:
```bash
python benchmark.py
```

This will test both algorithms on various graph types and sizes, with full correctness verification.

## 📊 Key Findings

### Performance Results
Our benchmarks reveal a nuanced picture:

| Graph Type | Size | BMSSP Time | Dijkstra Time | Winner |
|------------|------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Sparse Connected | 100 nodes | 0.045s | 0.008s | Dijkstra (5.6x) |
| Medium Sparse | 500 nodes | 0.234s | 0.043s | Dijkstra (5.4x) |
| Large Sparse | 1000 nodes | 0.521s | 0.089s | Dijkstra (5.9x) |
| 2D Grid | 400 nodes | 0.187s | 0.031s | Dijkstra (6.0x) |

### Why Dijkstra's Wins (For Now)

1. **Constant Factor Dominance**: At practical scales (< 10K nodes), BMSSP's implementation overhead outweighs its asymptotic advantages

2. **Language Overhead**: Python's recursion and object creation costs significantly impact BMSSP's complex control flow

3. **Hardware Reality**: Modern CPUs excel at the simple, cache-friendly operations that characterize Dijkstra's algorithm

4. **Scale Threshold**: The crossover point where BMSSP becomes advantageous likely occurs at much larger scales (millions of nodes)

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### The Specialized Priority Queue

The heart of BMSSP's theoretical advantage:

```python
class SpecializedPriorityQueue:
    def batch_decrease_key(self, updates):
        """Process multiple distance updates efficiently"""
        self.pending_updates.extend(updates)
    
    def extract_min(self):
        """Extract minimum element after processing batch updates"""
        self._process_pending_updates()
        # ... bucket-based extraction logic
```

### Recursive Architecture

BMSSP's divide-and-conquer approach:

```python
def bmssp(self, sources, bound, current_depth=0):
    # Base case: Fast Dijkstra exploration
    explored = self.fast_dijkstra(sources, bound)
    
    # Recursive case: Explore promising regions
    while not frontier_queue.is_empty():
        vertex, distance = frontier_queue.extract_min()
        remaining_bound = bound - distance
        
        # Recursive subproblem
        sub_result = self.bmssp({vertex}, remaining_bound, current_depth + 1)
        explored.update(sub_result)
```
